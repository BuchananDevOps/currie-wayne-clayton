# Currie Wayne Clayton

Website I built for my dawg Currie Wayne Micheal Clayton Jr. by Buchanan Computer.  

## Getting started

To get started incase developer expires. 

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create a new Sanity project to power the blog within this template:

```bash
npm create sanity@^4.2 -- --env=.env.local --create-project "CWC Blog" --dataset production
```

This will prompt you to create a new Sanity account if you don't have one already. When asked "Would you like to add configuration files for a Sanity project in this Next.js folder?", choose "n".

Next, optionally import the demo seed data for the blog:

```bash
npx sanity@^4.2 dataset import seed.tar.gz
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

To manage your blog content, visit the embedded Sanity Studio at [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio).
